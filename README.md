# Public Datasets

**Open data** helps create a lot of **public datasets** that you can access to make data-driven decisions. Here are some resources you can use to start searching for public datasets on your own:

- The [Google Cloud Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets) allow data analysts access to high-demand public datasets, and make it easy to uncover insights in the cloud.
- The [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) can help you find available datasets online with keyword searches.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=google.com+search&utm_campaign=datasets&gclid=CjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-L6PpACh6RzmrJjQjmNGCCE7kky1FCtc6Jf1qld-4NwDMYL0WsUyxBoCdwAQAvD_BwE) has an Open Data search function that can help you find datasets to practice with.
- Finally, [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) hosts 150+ public datasets you can access and use.
